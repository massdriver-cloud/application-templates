# azure-function-app

Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running. You focus on the code that matters most to you, in the most productive language for you, and Azure Functions handles the rest.

## Use cases
### Common scenarios
* Build a web API using [HTTP Trigger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook)
* Process file uploads in [blob storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage-blob)
* Build a serverless workflow using [Durable Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview)
* Respond to database changes in [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2)
* Run scheduled tasks on [pre-defined timed intervals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer)
* Create reliable message queue systems using [Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-hubs)
* [And more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview#scenarios)...
### Use your preferred language
Write functions in any language you want using a custom Docker image.

## Design
### Auto-CIDR Feature
The Masssdriver Auto CIDR feature takes the burden of selecting a CIDR range away from you by determining the next available CIDR range and automatically provisions it. You still have the option to manually set your CIDR range if you prefer.

## Best Practices
### Health checking
Health checks are enabled by default using a path of `/health` and port 80. You can change the path and port by updating the configuration in `src/main.tf` of your template.

## Security

## Observability
Massdriver gives you visibility into the health of your systems. By default, Azure Function Apps will be created with alarms to monitor at key performance degradation or failure thresholds. You will be notified when latency exceeds 1000ms.
